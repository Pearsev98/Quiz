Project Goals
My project goals with this game was to find a way to make the game fun and also text people knowledge so i picked a quiz to make about historical subjects that i have found interesting through my life and said i would text my family members over the Christmas time as a fun way to make the site but also to make sure it was easy to use for people who wouyld not have much experince with computers.
Target Audience
My target audience was people whpo never really used a comouer before so i tried to make it as easy to use as possible but also making it a nfun quiz for testing the knowledge of hsitorcal subjects 
Deployment Procedure
I satrted by making a front page for the quiz by using basic HTML and CSS to create a nice homepage that would be easy to navogate i started with this home page and created a link to the acualt game i coded using HTML+CSS and Javascript.
while makeing the game i came across a bug that the game itself would not start when i would click the start button i was confused a frustrated by this for quite some time but i found that i was using the wrong brackets within my javascript i was using the '{}' brackets for the closing of my questions rather then the '[]' this was easily corrected and the game begain to work smoothly and nicely to my enjoyment i enjoyed texting this game out on my friends and family and made a nice game of it over Chritmas testing the knowledge of these historcal figures using something a coded!.
